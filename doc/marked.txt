INTRODUCTION                                    *marked*

Vim plugin for Marked 2 (http://marked2app.com), a previewer for Markdown

content in Marked 2.

from stealing focus from Vim.

Close the Marked document corresponding to the current Markdown file. Call
with a bang to quit Marked completely.

:MarkedToggle[!]                                *marked-:MarkedToggle*

If the current Markdown file is already open in Marked, same as
`:MarkedQuit[!]`. If not, same as `:MarkedOpen[!]`.

:[range]MarkedPreview                          *marked-:MarkedPreview*

Send the current range (defaults to the enture buffer) to Marked as a preview.
